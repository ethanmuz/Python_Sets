# Python Sets

#### February 7, 2018

The sets I'm working with in Python, we learned about in Discrete Math. The main aspect that interested me is set multiplication, where {1,2,3} x {4,5,6} = {{1,4},{1,5},{1,6},{2,4},{2,5},{2,6},{3,4},{3,5},{3,6}}.

This was interesting to me because my professor discussed set multiplication using two sets, but never talked about it if there were more than two sets to be multiplied. I thought it would be cool to write a python program to see what it would look like if I multiplied three, four, five, etc. sets together.

I plan on including other functions soon too, such as union of sets, intersection of sets, difference of sets, and more.
