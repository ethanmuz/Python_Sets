# Python Sets

#### Developer Information:

Ethan Uzarowski (ethanmuz@gmail.com)

#### How to use:

Simply run the python file.

Input the first set you would like first. The set must be surrounded by curly braces, and each element seperated by a comma. If there are any spaces, they will be included as part of an element. Example of a set: ```{1,10,JOE}```. Now press ```ENTER```.

Do the same with the second set. The next printed result will be the product of the sets, following Set Multiplication.

Currently, this program only performs set multiplication, however I plan to implement more set functions soon.

#### Changelog:

2/7/2018: Set Multiplication feature is created. Look for more features soon!

#### Writeup:

I did a full writeup for developing this program, please take the time to check it out! It can be found [here](../master/Writeup.md) or by the Writeup.md file at this repository's top directory.
